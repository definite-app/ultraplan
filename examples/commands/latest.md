Find the most recent ultraplan session in ~/.ultraplan/sessions/ (look for the latest session_* directory by timestamp in the name).

Read the recording.md file from that session.

This recording contains:
- Audio transcriptions with timestamps
- Screenshots captured during the session (referenced as img_*.png)
- Clipboard content that was copied
- Keystrokes typed (if enabled)

Also check for any screenshot files (img_*.png) in the session directory and read them to understand visual context.

Provide a summary of what was captured:
1. **Session Overview** - When it happened, how long, what was recorded
2. **Content Summary** - Main topics, discussions, or activities
3. **Screenshots** - Describe any screenshots captured

Then ask: "How can I help you with this recording?"
